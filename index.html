                lift
                me up when I need you to. I am so incredibly fortunate to have crossed paths with you in the beginning.
                It has brought us to this beautiful point in our lives. A point where I find that I cannot wait to build
                with you, grow with you and face the future with you. You are everything I could ever want in a woman. I
                will never want anything or anyone else. That I can promise".</p>
